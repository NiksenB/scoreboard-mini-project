## Description
This is an extremely simple fullstack program that tracks and presents user points (for a game) on a scoreboard.

I have chosen to separate backend and frontend in a server and client folder. 

The **server** uses the Express.js framework (on top of Node.js). It uses hardcoded data, stored in a data.json file, but can just as easily be used with a postgres database.

The **client** uses the React framework.

## How to run
In both folders, run
```
npm run dev
```
